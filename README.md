The Machine Learning Zoo aims to provide resources and code examples for creating a vast variety of machine learning models, from simple multilayer perceptrons to Generative Adversarial Networks to Transformers.

If you're completely new to Machine Learning, welcome! If you check out the [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/ArvinSKushwaha/MLZoo/blob/master/getting_started.md) file, you can find some really helpful resources to get started!

For this repository, we will mainly be using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) for Machine Learning, however, if you're familiar with TensorFlow and would like to learn more about PyTorch, please visit the [PyTorch Tutorial Page](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html).
